# Work-in-progress

Of course this project isn't anything close to completion. Currently 
this is just well-formed idea, that hopefully will see the light one 
day.

# [GitHub | Octo] Steward

## Motivation

There is very useful GitHub functionality that is not used extensively, 
for example, releases and assets. This project is targeted to provide 
CLI-friendly ways to use them, so your CI would be much easier than it
was.

## Installation

Just look into [releases section](https://github.com/ayte-io/steward/releases) 
and pick latest one.

## Documentation

It was too big for readme, so it is available on 
[auxiliary website](https://ayte-io.github.io/steward).

## Licensing
